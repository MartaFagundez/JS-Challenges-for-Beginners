    In this challenge, you must generate a sequence of consecutive numbers, from a lower bound that will always be equal to 1, 
    up to a variable given higher bound (including the bounds in the sequence).
    Each number of the sequence that can be exactly divided by 4 must be amplified by 10 (see notes below).
    Given a higher bound num, implement a function that returns an array with the sequence of numbers, 
    after that every multiple of 4 has been amplified.
    Examples: 
        amplify(4) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40]
        // Create a sequence from 1 to 4
        // 4 is exactly divisible by 4, so it will be 4*10 = 40
        amplify(3) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
        // Create a sequence from 1 to 3
        // There are no numbers that can be exactly divided by 4
        amplify(25) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40, 5, 6, 7, 80, 9, 10, 11, 120, 13, 14, 15, 160, 17, 18, 19, 200, 21, 22, 23, 240, 25]
        // Create a sequence from 1 to 25
        // The numbers exactly divisible by 4 are: 4 (4*10 = 40), 8 (8 * 10 = 80)... and so on.
    Notes:
        The given parameter num will always be equal to or greater than 1.
        Remember to include the num as the higher bound of the sequence (see the Examples) above.
        A number a amplified by a factor b can also be read as: a * b.
        A number a is exactly divisible by a number b when the remainder of the division a / b is equal to 0.
